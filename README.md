# Lotka-Volterra-Project
In this work, we can observe the way in which a population of prey and predators coexists in an environment, the encounter of which provides a natural growth of the predatory population and a decrease in prey. The Lotka-Volterra equations consist of a pair of non-linear, first-order differential equations that describe dynamics in biological systems and allow a simplified understanding of interactions between prey and predators in a given period of time. To solve such equations, packages were used: SciPy, NumPy and MatPlotLib in order to demonstrate the practicality and versatility of the language in computational efforts in a notebook environment.
